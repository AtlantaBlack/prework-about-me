      <p>I am a barista at a popular little cake shop. It's nice getting to make tasty coffee every day.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Sydney, Australia</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Bush walking, baking, drawing/illustrating sometimes.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Getting to do something with my art, I think.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In a nice and quiet suburb that's close enough to the CBD without being right in there with all the people.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Coding seems like a very useful skill to have, and if I want to make virtual pet site or something one day, I'll have some means to do it!</p>
